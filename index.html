<p>Oi m8!</p>

<p>What did you just try to do?</p>

<p>Did you actually think this was a real Discord nitro link??</p>

<p>Well you&#39;re lucky that I didn&#39;t use this for malicious purposes.</p>

<p>This was a little presentation what might happen if you think everything on the internet is real!</p>

<p>Make sure you never click any &quot;Free nitro&quot; links anywhere even on discord.</p>

<p>Best way to avoid these scams is just to check the url.</p>

<p>The only real discord gift link is discord.gifts (or discord.gift)</p>

<p>Its really easy to fake a nitro link.</p>

<p>You have been warned.</p>

<p>Be safe out there!</p>
